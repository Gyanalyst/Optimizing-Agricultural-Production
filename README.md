# Optimizing-Agricultural-Production

# Problem Statement:
Build a predictive model to suggest the most suitable crops to grow based on the available climatic and soil conditions

# Goal:
Achieve Precision Farming by Optimizing the Agricultural Production

# About the Dataset:
_This dataset will help in recommending the crop for the suitable soil. This will be very useful in Optimizing Agricultural Production._

# Variable Names and their Uses:
**Nitrogen** is one of the chemical elements that become a part of amino acids. Plants synthesize nitrogen from soils along with other primary elements and turn them into amino acids. These chemical compounds are utilized by plants to increase the production and quality of crops.

**Phosphorus** plays a major role in the growth of new tissue and division of cells. Plants perform complex energy transmissions, a function that requires phosphorus.

**Potassium** is a paramount macro-element for the overall survival of living things. It is an abundant mineral macronutrient present in both plant and animal tissues. It is necessary for the proper functionality of all living cells.

**Temperature**: Germination is a miraculous event that involves several factors including air, water, light, and, of course, temperature. Germination increases in higher temperatures – up to a point. Once the seeds reach optimum temperatures, which depends on the plant, germination begins to decline.

The **pH** range of 5.5–6.5 is optimal for plant growth as the availability of nutrients is optimal. Besides disease, rainfall can also determine how fast a crop will grow from seed, including when it will be ready for harvesting. A good balance of rain and proper irrigation can lead to, which can cut down on germination time and the length between seeding and harvest
